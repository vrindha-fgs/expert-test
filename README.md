## Overview

This document outlines the major bugs that were discovered and resolved in the
Lead Capture Form component.

---

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Leads Not Saved to Database and Confirmation Email Triggered Multiple Times(twice)
**File**: src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed  

#### Problem  
Lead information submitted through the form was not being stored in the Supabase "leads" table.In addition, the "send-confirmation" email function was triggered twice, resulting in multiple confirmation emails being sent.

#### Root Cause  
The handleSubmit function lacked the logic to insert lead data into the database.
There was also an unintended duplicate execution of the confirmation email function.

#### Fix  
Implemented a Supabase insert operation to store lead data in the "leads" table before initiating the confirmation email.
Eliminated the redundant call to the email function to avoid sending multiple emails.

#### Impact

- ‚úÖ Lead data is now correctly stored in the database  
- ‚úÖ Each submission triggers a single confirmation email  
- ‚úÖ Enhanced reliability of lead records and tracking  
- ‚úÖ Eliminated duplicate emails, reducing overhead and improving efficiency

### 2.Resolved Incorrect Data Index Usage and Undefined Check in Confirmation Email Logic

**File**: supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem
The confirmation email system had two issues:

   ‚úÖ  Line breaks in the email body were not rendered correctly due to directly calling .replace() on potentially undefined content.

  ‚úÖ   The function incorrectly accessed the second item in the choices array from the OpenAI API response, which was often undefined, resulting in failed or blank email content.

These bugs caused:
    Emails rendering without proper formatting (missing line breaks).
    Emails being sent with empty or broken content.

#### Root Cause
Used ${personalizedContent.replace(/\n/g, '<br>')} without checking if personalizedContent was defined.

Incorrectly accessed choices[1] instead of choices[0] in the OpenAI response:
return data?.choices[1]?.message?.content; // ‚ùå invalid index

#### Fix
Safely handled undefined values by using:
${(personalizedContent ?? '').replace(/\n/g, "<br>")}

Corrected the index when accessing the OpenAI response:
return data?.choices[0]?.message?.content;


#### Impact

- ‚úÖ Proper formatting of email content with preserved line breaks  
- ‚úÖ Emails now consistently include personalized content  
- ‚úÖ Improved reliability and debugging of the `send-confirmation` function  
- ‚úÖ Reduced risk of broken or malformed emails being sent to users
